-- "div" receive a call to "main content", and "main" receives a call to
-- "content" as argument. They receive those as an implicit "content" entry
-- in the environment. This example shows that calling "content" works (instead
-- of making an infinite loop, resolving it as the implicit "content" passed to
-- "div" or to "main", instead of the one passed to "f").

frag f
  div
    main
      content

f
  p A.
